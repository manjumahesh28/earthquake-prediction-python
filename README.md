# 🌍 Earthquake Prediction Using Python

This project focuses on the **prediction of earthquakes** using historical seismic data and **machine learning techniques**. The goal is to analyze patterns in earthquake data and build a model that can estimate the likelihood or magnitude of future seismic events.

The system processes past earthquake records, applies data preprocessing and feature engineering, and trains a predictive model to identify trends in seismic activity. This project is intended as a **research and educational tool** to explore how data science and machine learning can be applied to geophysical problems.
